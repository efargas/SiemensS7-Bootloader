# Siemens S7 PLCs Bootloader Arbitrary Code Execution Utility

This repository describes the way we get non-invasive arbitrary code execution on the Siemens S7 PLC by using an undocumented bootloader protocol over UART. Siemens assigned SSA-686531 (CVE-2019-13945) for this vulnerability. Affected devices are Siemens S7-1200 (all variants including SIPLUS) and S7-200 Smart. The list of the content are as follows:






## Target Device Overview

In this section we will provide quick overview about the device. 



### Hardware
We used an S71200, CPU 1212C DC/DC/DC [6ES7 212-1AE40-0XB0](https://mall.industry.siemens.com/mall/en/WW/Catalog/Product/6ES7212-1AE40-0XB0) for our research.
The SoC in the our device was an A5E30235063 relabelled as Siemens SoC. However, the SoC decapsulation reveals that the SoC is based on Renesas 811005 (model 2010) as illustrated in the figure below:

### Instruction Set
The exact version of the ARM instruction set running on the PLC was queried using the following ARM instruction:
```asm
mrc p15, 0, r0, c0, c0, 0
```
We got a response with value 0x411fc143 (0b1000001000111111100000101000011), meaning that it is a ARM Cortex R4 Revision 3, ARMv7 R, Thumb 2 Real-Time profile SoC with Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA), based on a Memory Protection Unit (MPU). 

### NAND Flash Spec
The S7-1200 DC/DC/DC v2018 is using Micron Technologies NQ281 (FBGA code) 1Gbit (128MB) flash. Using Micron FBGA decoder we could get the part number of the flash. The part number is MT29F1G16ABBDAHC-IT:D. Note that in mid 2019, Siemens updated the NAND Flash to NW812 (MT29F1G08ABBFAH4-ITE:F).

### RAM
Siemens S7-1212C v4 is using a 1GB Winbond W94AD2KB or 256MB W948D2FBJX6E high-speed LPDDR1 SDRAM or a Micron Technologies MT46H32M32LFB5-5 IT (FBGA code D9LRB) in a 90-Ball VFBGA form. The RAM is running at 100Mhz. 



## Bootloader UART Protocol Overview

An interesting observation we made when looking at the firmware more deeply to investigate non-invasive access techniques is a protocol over UART during the very early boot stage implemented by the bootloader (v4.2.1). During startup, the bootloader waits for half a second, listening on the serial input to receive a magic sequence of bytes. Upon receiving those bytes in the given timeframe the bootloader enters a special protocol offering a large variety of functionality over serial. A client for the UART protocol containing functionality to execute payloads on the PLC from within early boot is implemented in [this utility](client.py).


### Initial Handshake

In the bootloader at address `0x0368` is called to wait for a magic string "MFGT1" within half a second. If such a string is encountered, it will answer with the string "-CPU" and return 1 to indicate that the protocol handler is getting executed. The return value of this function is checked at `0x0EDF0` and the protocol handler at `0xF3D0` is entered if the initial handshake has been performed.




### Handler Types
The UART protocol handler exposes a list of low level functions. There are multiple layers of handlers present in the system:
1. Primary Handlers: A primary list of handlers that can be invoked directly from the first protocol stage. They are stored in a table inside the bootloader starting at address `0x014D98` with 128 entries.
2. Additional Hooks: The first stage handler residing at address `0x00011180` with the assigned handler index `0x1c` allows calling hooks from a second list starting at `0x00015280`. 
3. Subprotocol: A Primary Handler 0x80 at `0x0000D1F0` (handler index `0x80`) enters an additional menu loop exposing what seems to be a setup/read/write triple of operations for different kinds of devices/components in the system such as flash, IRAM and an unknown device type.


### Packet/Message Format
Whenever contents are sent by one party, the following structure is expected by the protocol:
```
<length_byte><contents><checksum_byte>
```
The length is a single byte value field describing the length of `contents`+1. The checksum is a byte that completes the sum of all input bytes (including the length byte) to `0 mod 0x100`.



### Handler Type Implementations

#### 1. Primary Handler
The Primary Handler function is located at `0x0000EE48`. Commands are accepted in the form of single packets/messages as described above. After a correctly checksum packet is received, the first byte of the packet is interpreted as the command number.

For command number `0x80`, the Subprotocol handler is invoked in a mode based on the next two bytes of the incoming message (`0x3BC2`: mode 1, `0x9D26`: mode 2, `0xE17A`: mode 3, `0xC54F`: mode 4).
Command number `0xA2` represents the exit command. Command `0xA0` allows some configuration of the UART protocol. The semantics are not yet exactly determined.

For command numbers lower or equal `0xB0`, the respective Primary Hook inside the handler table starting at `0x00014D98` is invoked.



#### 2. Additional Hooks
A second layer of handlers is accessible via the first stage handler residing at address `0x00011180` with the assigned handler index `0x1c`. It relays invocations to a second layer of functions based on the arguments provided inside the packets sent by the other side of the protocol. The list of this secondary handler is initially stored in a table starting at `0x00015280` inside the bootloader. Before actual usage the table is then copied over to `0x1003ABA0` and then the copy in RAM is accessed rather than contents in the bootloader. This is important as overriding the actually used function pointers does not involve modifying bootloader memory (which may expected to be read-only and may trigger detection mechanisms and failing checksum tests).

The table containing the additional hooks has 33 entries. The index of this hook is checked against the boundaries `0<=index<=32`. Also, each table entry contains information about the length of the input expected by the particular additional hook:
- `0`: The handler is disabled
- `1-0xfe`: The input length has to match the given value exactly
- `0xff`: Variable input length


A list of the Additional hooks can be retrieved from the list inside the bootloader starting at `0x15280` . The reversing maturity of those handlers is not very advanced so a list is not generated here. Looking at the actual functions should be the best option to understand the range of functionality should the need arise. By default most handlers are disabled from being executed directly.






##### Subprotocol (Primary Handler `0x80`) Details
This handler seems to be responsible for performing updates of different components over UART. To enter this protocol in one of four modes, handler `0x80` has to be invoked with a 2-byte argument describing the mode used by the sub handler. Every mode corresponds to one component to be updated:

| Mode Number | Component |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 1 | Hardware device mapped to memory around region `0x10000000`. This seems to match IRAM memory |
| 2 | SPI1 / IOC mappings are used here, exact component so far unknown |
| 3 | Firmware flash memory |
| 4 | NOP |

For each component, three to four types of functions are supported. The rough semantics are: Preparation/Setup, (Metadata) Read, (Update) Write, Cleanup.

When the subprotocol handler is entered, another loop handling commands sent via UART is performed. At least one argument byte is expected from here which - together with the overall input length - acts as a switch for the function to be used.

The handler that is the most important for getting code execution is handler number 1 (writes internal memory such as ITCM and IRAM).
A way to update flash contents is sub-handler number 3. 




## Non-Invasive Arbitrary Code Execution
Using a combination of the functionality provided above we were able to gain arbitrary code execution on the device using the UART protocol. The client implementing this is located at [client.py](client.py).

The idea behind the implementation is as follows:
- Use the subprotocol handler's memory RAM update component to inject a custom shellcode payload to IRAM. This is implemented as the first step in the function `_exploit_install_add_hook` in [client.py](client.py)
- Use the subprotocol handler's memory RAM update component to create a function pointer to the custom shellcode above by injecting an additional hook address into the additional hook table in IRAM at `0x1003ABA0`. This is implemented as the second step in the function `_exploit_install_add_hook` in [client.py](client.py)
- Use the handler `0x1c` to call the custom shellcode. This is implemented in the function `invoke_add_hook` in [client.py](client.py)




#### RCE in older PLCs
We spotted similar functionality in 2014 models of S7-1212C Siemens PLCs (6ES7212-1BE31-0XB0). The bootloader functionality was spotted at offset 0xE664 of older PLC bootloader (S7-1200v3).

## Setting up the Build Environment (Ubuntu 16.04)

This project requires specific versions of Python, Python libraries, and ARM cross-compilation toolchains. The following instructions are for setting up the environment on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system.

### 1. System Package Installation

First, update your package list and install essential tools like `make`, Python 2, pip for Python 2, and the necessary ARM cross-compilers:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y make python2.7 python-pip \
                        gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi \
                        clang \
                        gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi
```

**Toolchain Notes:**
*   **`gcc-arm-none-eabi` / `binutils-arm-none-eabi`**: Used for compiling the C-based payloads (e.g., `tic_tac_toe`, `dump_mem`, `hello_loop`) via `make`. The configuration in `payloads/makeinc/config.mk` uses `clang` as the C compiler and `arm-none-eabi-ld` as the linker.
*   **`clang`**: Required as it's specified as the C compiler for the `make`-based payloads.
*   **`gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi` / `binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi`**: Used for assembling the `.s` assembly payloads (e.g., `hello_world`, `stager`) via their respective `build.sh` scripts.

### 2. Python Library Installation

The client scripts require Python 2 and specific libraries. Install them using `pip`:

```bash
sudo pip install pwntools requests
```
If you encounter issues installing `pwntools` due to dependencies, you might need to install Python development headers and other system libraries first:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python2.7-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
# Then retry pip install:
sudo pip install pwntools requests
```

### 3. Note on `arm-none-eabi-ld` and `--nostartfiles` flag

The linker flags in `payloads/makeinc/config.mk` include `--nostartfiles`. This flag is **not a standard option for `arm-none-eabi-ld`** and may cause errors with `arm-none-eabi-ld` version 2.42 and potentially other versions.

If you are using `arm-none-eabi-ld` version 2.42 or newer, it is recommended to **remove `--nostartfiles`** from the `LDFLAGS` variable in `payloads/makeinc/config.mk`.

The desired behavior (not linking standard system startup files) is already effectively achieved by the combination of:
*   The `-nostdlib` flag (which is also present in `LDFLAGS`).
*   The custom linker script (e.g., `link.ld` in each payload directory) specified with `-Tlink.ld`.
*   The project providing its own startup code where necessary (e.g., `start.S` or specific C startup routines).

To modify it, edit `payloads/makeinc/config.mk`. Change:
```makefile
LDFLAGS := \
    -EB \
    -Tlink.ld \
    -nostdlib \
    --gc-sections \
    -nostartfiles
```
To:
```makefile
LDFLAGS := \
    -EB \
    -Tlink.ld \
    -nostdlib \
    --gc-sections
```

### 4. Compiling and Testing Payloads

Once the environment is set up, you can compile the payloads.

*   **For C-based payloads (in `payloads/dump_mem`, `payloads/hello_loop`, `payloads/tic_tac_toe`):**
    Navigate to the payload's directory and run `make`:
    ```bash
    cd payloads/tic_tac_toe
    make
    ```
    This will create the binary (e.g., `build/tic_tac_toe.bin`) in a `build` subdirectory.

*   **For assembly-based payloads (in `payloads/hello_world`, `payloads/stager`):**
    Navigate to the payload's directory and run the `build.sh` script:
    ```bash
    cd payloads/hello_world
    sh build.sh
    ```
    This will create the binary (e.g., `hello_world.bin`) in the same directory.

**Testing Compilation:**
To ensure your environment is correctly set up, try compiling a few different payloads:
1.  Compile `payloads/tic_tac_toe/` using `make`.
2.  Compile `payloads/hello_world/` using `sh build.sh`.

If these compilations succeed without error, your build environment should be ready. You can then proceed with using the `client.py` utility as described elsewhere in this README.


### UART Wiring
To be able to utilize this utility you need to connect to a UART interface of the PLC. For the pins on the side of the PLC (next to the RUN/STOP LEDs), populate the top row like the following: 

![PLC RX-TX pinout](./pics/txrxgnd.png).


One can use any TTL 3.3V device. Obviously you should connect TX pin of the TTL adapter to the RX port of the PLC and RX port of the TTL adapter to the TX port of the PLC. 



## Using our tool

After setting up the environment and compiling the payloads, you can use the main utility.
Ensure your TTYUSB adapter (generally `/dev/ttyUSB0`, which is hardcoded in `start.sh`) is connected.
You also need to set the IP address of your `ALLNET ALL3075V3` power supply to `192.168.0.100` (this can be changed in `client.sh`).

The general workflow involves:
1. Compiling the desired payload (as described in "Compiling and Testing Payloads" above).
2. Running `start.sh` to forward UART serial data to a TCP port.
3. Running `client.sh` with appropriate arguments to interact with the PLC.


For example, to compile the `hello_world` payload (which is used for the `test` mode):


```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce/payloads/hello_world/$ sh build.sh
```

Once we are done compiling the payloads for Cortex-R4 CPU, we can open the channel for forwarding our UART serial data to a TCP port which will be used by our client utility. This console window should show you raw UART traffic between PLC and client utility:

```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce$ sh start.sh
```

### DEMO 1: Upload and executing stager and test payloads 

Now, we can use our client utility. Open a new console window (without closing the console which runs `start.sh`), and type the following command for uploading the stager and test payload to the UART: 

```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce$ sh client.sh --switch-power --powersupply-delay=1 test
```

The `--powersupply-delay` is provided for Cold-boot style firmware dumping (we do not use it at this stage but providing this item is required). The argument `test` uses the payload in `payloads/hello_world/hello_world.bin` file. This payload literraly just run inside the PLC and send string `TEST` back to the client, thus client knows the code successfully executed inside the PLC.  






### DEMO 2: Upload and execution Tic-tac-toe inside the S7 PLC


In this demo we decided to upload the Tic-tac-toe game to the PLC. The goal of this demo is to demonstrate running more complex form of programs inside the PLC. To upload the game, you need to first compile it: 



```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce/payloads/tic_tac_toe$ make
cc tic_tac_toe.c
cc ../lib/stdlib.c
cc ../lib/print.c
cc ../lib/string.c
cc ../lib/read.c
ld tic_tac_toe.sym
strip tic_tac_toe
objcopy tic_tac_toe.ihex
objcopy tic_tac_toe.bin
```

Now we must use the tictactoe mode of our script utility as it allows us to interact with the PLC and have stream of input/output:


```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce$ sh client.sh --switch-power --powersupply-delay=1 tictactoe --payload=payloads/tictactoe/build/tictactoe.bin
```

Note that the tictactoe mode, allow us to use alternative payloads using `--payload` argument. So we are not bounded to only use the tictactoe.bin payload. 


### DEMO 3: Running the Greetings From PLC in an infinite loop

We have alternate version of `hello_world` which the PLC instead of sending a single string `TEST` back to the client utility, it will send string `Gretings from PLC` in an infinite loop to the client utility.  This payload is located inside `uart_rce/payloads/hello_loop/`. Since this payload is written in C, you need to compile it using make command: 


```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce/payloads/hello_loop$ make
cc hello_loop.c
cc ../lib/stdlib.c
cc ../lib/print.c
cc ../lib/string.c
cc ../lib/read.c
ld hello_loop.sym
strip hello_loop
objcopy hello_loop.ihex
objcopy hello_loop.bin
```

This will generate `hello_loop.bin` file, which will be used by our client utility and will be uploaded to the PLC to get executed. Now we can send the payload to the PLC using tictactoe mode with different payload:


```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce$ sh client.sh --switch-power --powersupply-delay=1 tictactoe --payload=payloads/hello_loop/build/hello_loop.bin
```



### DEMO 4: Dumping S7 PLC RAM

To dump the PLC memory, we would recommend to first turn on the PLC for few seconds, to let the PLC copy contents of the NAND flash to the RAM (alternatively you can wait as long as you want!). We specially designed `--powersupply-delay` argument in our utility for this purpose. We use dump mode in our utility followed by `-a` argument which user supplies address to dump and `-l` argument for the byte size. 

Similar to other demos we need to first compile our payload:

```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce/payloads/dump_mem$ make
cc dump_mem.c
cc ../lib/stdlib.c
cc ../lib/print.c
cc ../lib/string.c
cc ../lib/read.c
ld dump_mem.sym
strip dump_mem
objcopy dump_mem.ihex
objcopy dump_mem.bin
```


Now we are ready to dump the PLC. Here we put power supply delay argument to 30 seconds (PLC turn on, wait 30 seconds for PLC to boot, then reset it and use special access feature). 


```console
research@ali-Plex-9:~/SiemensS7-Bootloader/uart_rce$ sh client_bricked.sh --switch-power --powersupply-delay=30 dump -a 0x691E28 -l 256
```

In this example, we dump 256 bytes starting from offset `0x691E28` of the PLC memory. Once utility dump the memory, it place it in `uart_rce/` folder with the prefix `mem_dump_` plus start and end range address (mem_dump_00691e28_00691f28). 



## Possible Issues: 

The client utility generally inform you about existence of special access feature on the PLC bootloader. It also fetch the bootloader version from the PLC, as shown below:

```console
Looping now
[+] Got connection
[+] Got special access greeting: -CPU [2d435055]
[*] sending packet: 0200fe
[+] Got PLC bootLoader version: V4.2.1
[*] sending packet: 04803bc27f
```


Our utility currently only supports S7 bootloader version `4.2.1`. The client utility can inform you which bootloader version you are using but fails to communicate with stager or upload the payload. To use it with different S7 PLC with other bootloader version, you probably need to dump the new bootloader from the PLC SPI flash (no desoldering required) and identify various hardcoded function addresses we have in `uart_rce/payloads/`, `uart_rce/stager/` and `uart_rce/lib/`.
