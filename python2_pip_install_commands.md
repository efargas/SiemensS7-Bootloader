# Commands to install Python libraries 'pwn' and 'requests' using pip
# Assumes a Python 2.7 virtual environment is already activated.

# Install pwntools
# For Python 2.7, pip will attempt to find the latest compatible version.
pip install pwn

# Install requests
# For Python 2.7, pip will attempt to find the latest compatible version.
# Requests version 2.22.0 was the last to support Python 2.7.
# If 'pip install requests' fails or installs an incompatible version,
# you might need to specify the version: pip install requests==2.22.0
pip install requests

# Note:
# The commands above will attempt to install the latest versions of 'pwn' and 'requests'
# that are compatible with Python 2.7 as determined by pip.
#
# - For 'pwn' (pwntools), the library developers made efforts for continued Py2 support for a time,
#   but newer versions are Python 3 only. Pip should resolve to a compatible version.
# - For 'requests', version 2.22.0 is the last one that officially supported Python 2.7.
#   `pip install requests` in a Python 2.7 environment should ideally pick a compatible version,
#   but if issues arise, specifying `requests==2.22.0` might be necessary.
#
# If you encounter issues or require older/specific versions of these libraries,
# you may need to adjust the commands (e.g., `pip install pwn==<version>`).
